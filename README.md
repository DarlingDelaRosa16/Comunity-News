# Comunity app

That is aplication created for practice and learn. this one is for create news like a journalist and post in the app. For create one you need to have access, you can use this profile(`Username`: `journalist`, `Password`: `1234`),  Take care whit the space in username. The app is posted [here](https://comunity-app.netlify.app/).

The aplication works by means of categories you need to select one of these for see the information. 

For example if you want to know about software you can click in the button (JavaScript) and then the aplication will show to
you all the diferents comunity what are alredy created.

You can create (Comunity, Categories and users) but for do this you need to use a diferent profile.
you can use this (`Username`: `dnomar165`, `Password`: `1234`).

Comunity-app works whit a context so the app changed its state when we press a botton

- Md5 is not working I skip this becouse is only a example.
- A wonderful style is not the purpose of the project
- The image of the news are links not files. In the moment when you create a new news 
  you will need a image alredy posted.
